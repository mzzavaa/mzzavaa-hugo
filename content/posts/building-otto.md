# The Birth of OTTO: How We Built an AI Crew for Our AWS Community

Every user group starts small.

A few passionate people.  
A few meetups.  
A few pizzas.

But if you’re lucky — if you care deeply, show up often, and invite others to lead too — it grows into something much bigger.

Today, our AWS User Group Austria has over **2000 members**.  
We have **five incredible organizers** across Vienna, Linz, and beyond.  
And the movement is still growing.

But before all of that — before the scale and the team —  
there were just two of us: **Philipp** and **me**.  
And a mountain of invisible work.

## 🧠 From “We Got This” to “We Need Help”

Both of us had been there:  
Running meetups **alone**.  
Chasing speakers.  
Begging venues.  
Writing emails at midnight.  
Publishing events while juggling full-time jobs and side projects.

At first, it felt manageable.  
But growth — beautiful as it is — **amplifies friction**.  
And friction, over time, wears you down.

Even when Philipp and I teamed up officially, it became clear:  
**Two people can't scale a community past a certain point alone.**

We didn’t want to slow down.  
We didn’t want to lower our standards.  
We didn’t want to burn out.

We needed backup.

## 🤖 Not More Humans. A Crew.

We didn’t dream of another project management board.  
Or a calendar full of Zoom calls.  
Or spreadsheets nobody updated.

We dreamed of something smarter.  
Something alive.

A **crew** — but made of AI agents.

Each agent would catch a different ball:
- A **Speaker Finder** to surface great speakers automatically
- An **Agenda Producer** to draft meetups
- A **Q&A Agent** to answer the 100th "what is the AWS User Group?" email
- A **GitHub Updater** to track our tasks
- A **Header Generator** to create visuals without fiddling with Canva

Not a monolithic app.  
Not another to-do list.  
**A modular, intelligent crew.**

## 🔥 Building OTTO

We sat down and started sketching it out —  
sometimes in late-night sessions, sometimes between other projects, sometimes just dreaming aloud.

It felt crazy.  
It felt necessary.  
It felt *right*.

We chose:
- **CrewAI** to organize the agents
- **Amazon Bedrock** to host custom-tuned models
- **InstructLab** to train the agents on our domain knowledge
- **Slack** as our mission control center

> We didn’t want a better tool.  
> We wanted a better way to work.

## 🌱 Where We Are Now

Today, we’re not alone anymore.

The AWS User Group Austria has a full team of passionate leaders.  
We’ve expanded meetups beyond Vienna into Linz and other cities.  
And soon — very soon — we’ll deploy **OTTO into our real environment**.

Every agent we built will be tested live:  
- Real event planning  
- Real speaker scouting  
- Real GitHub syncs  
- Real Slack conversations

We'll gather feedback.  
We'll tune and retrain the agents.  
We'll make OTTO better with every real-world cycle.

Because that’s the secret:  
**Communities aren’t static. Neither is OTTO.**

## 🚀 What’s Next

This is just the first part of OTTO’s story.

Next, we'll dive into **how we designed the architecture**:  
the way the agents interact, how we trained knowledge into them,  
and why starting small and modular made all the difference.

➡️ _Stay tuned for Part 2: "Turning Chaos into Crew: Designing OTTO's Architecture"_
