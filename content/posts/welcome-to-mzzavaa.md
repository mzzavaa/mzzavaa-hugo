# Welcome to Mzzavaa

Hi, I’m Linda – and **MzZavaa** is one of my playgrounds.

I’ve spent over a decade in tech—starting out as a developer, then leading cloud projects, mentoring in AI, organizing communities, and eventually becoming an AWS Hero. I’ve given keynotes on how AI and creativity intersect, mentored people entering the cloud space, and built real tools for real communities. But here’s the thing:

I’ve always been a *maker* at heart.  
Even before code, there were colored pencils.  
Before cloud, there were sketchbooks, sewing needles, and a dream of becoming a fashion designer.

This blog is my personal time capsule. It’s where I slow down, look back, and connect the dots of 20+ years of tinkering—from styling my Myspace profile in the early 2000s to sketching complex agent systems with CrewAI.

Mzzavaa is about:
- ✏️ Learning by doing (and redoing… and redoing again)
- 🎨 Letting creativity breathe next to code
- 🧵 Being brave enough to try something new (even if you suck at first)
- 💻 Embracing tech as a tool, not a title

This is *not* a portfolio.  
It’s a mirror. A map. A messy journal with half-finished portraits and half-baked apps. And it’s mine.

## 🧭 What You’ll Find Here

Whether I’m sewing corsets, training LLMs, building Slackbots for community planning, or sketching a portrait while watching architecture videos—everything here is connected by one thread:

> I want to understand how things work. And then bend them into something personal.

Here’s a glimpse of what I’ve been building, sketching, stitching, and shipping:

- 🧵 **My First Princess Dress** – Because learning how to sew corsets from scratch is a kind of engineering
- 🪐 **Moon and Mark-Making** – Playing with pencils and textures to build depth
- 🎭 **Portraits, People & Half Faces** – Because I rarely finish the second half (and that’s okay)
- 🤖 **AI Agents and OTTO** – Automating the boring parts of meetup planning
- 🎪 **Juggling + Keynotes** – Combining circus arts and cloud to explain complexity on stage
- ✍️ **Tattooing Binary 7** – A permanent reminder that my story is mine to tell

## 🗂 Upcoming Series: *Learn Anything*

The next posts will dive deep into:
1. **Sewing a Princess Dress** – from zero to corset (with no prior knowledge)
2. **Learning to Juggle** – and why it helped me survive long meetings
3. **Creating OTTO** – my Slackbot + AI crew for AWS meetups
4. **Tattooing Binary 7** – when tech and identity merge
5. **The Cloud and Me** – AWS, credits, MVPs, and midnight experiments
6. **Drawing Realism** – what YouTube taught me when schools didn’t
7. **Making Keynotes Magical** – using live face tracking and juggling on stage
8. **Learning Instruments** – how imperfection became a friend
9. **Building Community at Scale** – from AWS User Groups to 2000+ attendees
10. **The 10-Year Plan** – and what it feels like to hit *every* goal
