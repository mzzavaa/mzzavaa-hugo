# Welcome to Mzzavaa

Welcome to **Mzzavaa** – my little corner of the internet dedicated to personal growth through creative exploration. This blog isn’t about perfection. It’s about process. It’s about learning in public, failing with flair, and following curiosity wherever it goes – whether that’s code, cloud, corsets, or clubs.

## What You'll Find Here

I’ve spent the last 12 years in tech – as a software developer, product owner, cloud architect, AI explorer, community leader, and keynote speaker. But what people rarely see is the **parallel life** I’ve been living outside of job titles: learning juggling through muscle memory, sewing my first princess dress from scratch, tattooing binary onto my skin, building digital agents to assist with meetups, and sketching hyperrealistic portraits while listening to cloud podcasts.

**Mzzavaa** is where I show you that world.

This blog is for anyone who:
- Wants to learn something new but doesn’t know where to start
- Feels like they’re “late” to explore a hobby or tech topic
- Believes learning is a lifelong, messy, magical thing

Whether you’re in tech, art, education, or just curious – you belong here.

Let’s begin with one of my proudest side quests so far: sewing my very first dress.
