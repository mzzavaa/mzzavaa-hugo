# How We Grew AWS User Group Vienna to 2,000+ Members

When I first took over AWS User Group Vienna in 2020, it was a group of passionate cloud builders — but smaller, quieter, still finding its rhythm. We had **under 1,000 members**, and like so many community efforts, it risked fading if no one kept it alive.

Fast forward to today:  
**Over 2,000 members.**  
**Five organizers.**  
**Monthly meetups in two cities (Vienna and Linz).**  
**Special events like Community Days and Women’s User Group meetups.**  

And most importantly: **a real sense of belonging.**  
Not just for AWS users — but for builders, dreamers, learners, and teachers.

Here's the honest story of how we did it.

---

## 🚀 1. We Never Treated It Like a "Side Project"

Community isn’t something you can half-commit to.  
It’s not "just an event once a month." It’s hundreds of micro-decisions you make between events — how you answer questions, how you invite someone new, how you design experiences that people *feel*, not just attend.

Even when I was juggling a full-time job, part-time study, self-teaching AWS, and learning juggling (literally and figuratively), I made time for this.

Because I knew:  
> **If we show up consistently, others will too.**

## 🎯 2. We Focused on Quality, Not Just Quantity

- **Real talks**: No vendor pitches. Every session had to **teach** something — not just market something.
- **Community first**: We prioritized speakers who **live the cloud journey** — practitioners, builders, hobbyists — not just polished marketing presentations.
- **Consistency**: Monthly cadence (except for July and August, when we hold casual "Stammtisch" sessions to keep the heartbeat going).

## 🌱 3. We Built a Team — and Trusted Each Other

For a long time, I managed the User Group almost alone (and Philipp did too, before I joined).  
But sustainable growth needs shared ownership.

Now, we're five organizers, spread across Austria:

- Linda (Me)
- Philipp
- Dima
- Roman
- Jakob
- Matthias (Pub-Quizmaster)


Each person brings their own energy, network, and ideas. We meet regularly to plan — but we trust each other to take ownership when needed.

It's not about titles. It's about trust.

## 🛠 4. We Automated What Didn't Need to Be Manual

Organizing meetups manually — speaker sourcing, agenda drafting, Q&A — is *hard* and often repetitive.  
So we did what AWS users do best: we **built automation**.

Together with Philipp, we created **OTTO** — a CrewAI-powered assistant system that helps us plan, find speakers, draft agendas, and answer FAQs.  
(Stay tuned — a full blog post about OTTO is coming soon.)

Automation freed us to focus on what matters: **people.**

## 🌍 5. We Expanded Beyond Vienna

When we saw interest growing outside of Vienna, we didn’t wait for someone else to act.  
We launched AWS User Group Linz meetups too — making sure we could support builders wherever they are.

We believe communities shouldn’t be locked to one city.  
**Cloud is everywhere. Community should be too.**

## 🌟 6. We Celebrated Diversity

Representation matters.  
It’s why I also helped launch the **AWS Women's User Group Vienna** — to create more visible spaces where women feel seen, heard, and supported in the cloud ecosystem. The meetups happen once every quarter and during summertime we meet all together.

We bring **more female speakers** on stage,  
We highlight their stories,  
And we make sure everyone — no matter their background — knows they are welcome here.

# ✨ What Makes AWS UG Vienna Different?

- We **care** about the people first, not the companies they work for.
- We **refuse** vendor-only talks unless there’s real, practical value.
- We **experiment** — from casual Stammtische to technical deep-dives to massive Community Days.
- We **support** beginner talks and first-time speakers.
- We **build automation** (like OTTO) to make the experience better for everyone.
- We **stay curious** — always open to new topics, new formats, new ideas.
- And we **remember** why we started: **to learn, to teach, to build. Together.**

# 🛤 Where We're Going Next

- **Use OTTO** in our real workflows — speaker scouting, Q&A, event planning.
- **Grow AWS User Group Linz** alongside Vienna.
- **Support more new speakers** from the community itself.
- **Host bigger Community Days** (and make them even more inclusive and fun).
- **Build cross-city and cross-country collaborations** — because learning knows no borders.
