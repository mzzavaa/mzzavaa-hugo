# Mzzavaa Hugo Theme

A modern, responsive Hugo theme with an Apple-inspired design.

## Theme Structure

The theme has been refactored for better maintainability and follows Hugo best practices:

### Key Directories

- `/themes/mzzavaa-theme/layouts/`: Contains all template files
  - `/_default/`: Base templates for all content types
  - `/partials/`: Reusable template components
  - `/partials/post/`: Blog post specific components
  - `/shortcodes/`: Custom shortcodes for content

### Files You Should Modify

When customizing the theme, focus on these files:

1. **For blog post layout changes**:
   - Edit the partials in `/themes/mzzavaa-theme/layouts/partials/post/`
   - Each component is separated: hero-banner.html, navigation.html, content.html, meta.html

2. **For styling changes**:
   - Edit `/themes/mzzavaa-theme/static/css/style.css`

3. **For site-wide layout changes**:
   - Edit `/themes/mzzavaa-theme/layouts/_default/baseof.html`

4. **For homepage changes**:
   - Edit `/themes/mzzavaa-theme/layouts/index.html`

5. **For list page changes**:
   - Edit `/themes/mzzavaa-theme/layouts/_default/list.html`

### Files You Should NOT Modify

- Any files in the `/public/` directory (these are generated by Hugo)
- Hugo's internal templates (referenced with `{{ template "_internal/xxx.html" }}`)

## Content Management

- Place all blog posts in `/content/posts/`
- Use front matter to configure each post:
  - `image`: Main hero banner image
  - `thumbnail`: Optional smaller image for the first paragraph

## Theme Features

- Responsive design for all devices
- Dark/light mode support
- Gradient text headings
- Hero banner images for blog posts
- Thumbnail images that flow with text
- Previous/next post navigation
