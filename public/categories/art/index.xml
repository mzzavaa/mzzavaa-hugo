      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;sketches-smudges--scribbles-my-drawing-journey&#34;&gt;Sketches, Smudges &amp;amp; Scribbles: My Drawing Journey&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I wanted to be a fashion designer or a graphic designer. I’d draw half-finished people, sketch clothes I would never sew (until recently), and obsess over eyes and faces. It’s funny how some things stick. I never studied art, but I always came back to the pencil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drawing, for me, is not about perfection. It’s about translating an emotion I can’t quite explain with words. Most of the time, I don’t even finish a whole face. Half portraits are kind of my thing—mostly because I lose patience halfway through. But that’s okay. Because every time I pick up the pencil again, it’s a quiet little rebellion against perfectionism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
